# “To-Do List” is a simple JavaScript app that allows users to maintain a list of tasks. The user should also be able to edit, delete or mark tasks as complete.
    The app is written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
    The app is client-side only 
    When the user enters a task in the "To-do" textbox and clicks the ADD button, it will get added to the list
    If they type a task and hit the enter key, it will also get added to the list
    If the user checks the checkbox next to a task, the system will cross-out the task to mark it as completed
    If the user un-checks the checkbox next to a task, the system will remove the cross-out to mark the task as incomplete
    If the user clicks the delete link next to a task, that task will be removed from the list
    If the user clicks the edit link next to a task, the task will become editable
    The user will be able to save their edit by hitting the enter key
    If the user refreshes the page, the task list will be cleared
